## 🚀 Screenshot Setup

The screenshot demonstrates elektra on my main dev system with the following setup:

- **Theme**: Windows Terminal is using the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/windows-terminal) color palette, known for its warm and cozy feel.
- **Prompt**: The prompt shown uses [Starship](https://starship.rs/) with a modified version of the Pastel Powerline preset (available in my dotfiles repo).
- **Font**: My preferred console and coding font is [Pragmata Pro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro), a gorgeous monospace font 💜  It comes with the Nerd Fonts glyphs and is absolutely worth the cost, especially if you spend a lot of time in an IDE or terminal! 
- **System**: My gorgeous Hyperia dev machine where I spend a lot of my time! It's packed with RGB and has an amazing audio setup for music production. My WSL2 Linux environment is where most of my development happens.

Note that these are not part of the elektra theme itself but showcase how it can look in a customized environment.
